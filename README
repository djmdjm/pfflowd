Welcome to pfflowd, a PF to NetFlow converter daemon

pfflowd is a daemon which converts status update packets from pf(4) sent 
over its pfsync(4) interface to Cisco NetFlow(tm) datagrams. These UDP 
datagrams are then exported to a host of your choice.

PLEASE NOTE: pfflowd required kernel changes to pffsync committed after
OpenBSD 3.3 was released. The included pfsync-bidi-3.3.diff should
bring this support, but the diff is *completely* untested and unsupported.
Please don't complain to me or the OpenBSD mailing lists of this diff 
doesn't work (or if it breaks your kernel).

More details about pfflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpage, which you can view prior to installation using 

/usr/bin/nroff -mandoc pfflowd.8 | less

pfflowd itself is licensed under a two-term BSD license (see the source
files for details).
