Welcome to pfflowd, a PF to NetFlow converter daemon

pfflowd is a daemon which converts status update packets from pf(4) sent 
over its pfsync(4) interface to Cisco NetFlow(tm) datagrams. These UDP 
datagrams are then exported to a host of your choice.

More details about pfflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpage, which you can view prior to installation using 

/usr/bin/nroff -mandoc pfflowd.8 | less

pfflowd itself is licensed under a two-term BSD license (see the source
files for details). 

Please report bugs in softflowd to http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/ If you find
a security bug, please report it directly by email. If you have any feedback
or questions, please email me: 

PLEASE NOTE: 

1. By default, pfflowd only supports OpenBSD 3.5. This can be changed by 
setting the OLD_PFSYNC flag in the Makefile, in which case pfflowd will 
support only OpenBSD <= 3.4.

2. pfflowd required kernel changes to pffsync committed after OpenBSD 3.3 
was released. The included pfsync-bidi-3.3.diff should bring this support, 
but the diff is *completely* untested and unsupported.  Please don't 
complain to me or the OpenBSD mailing lists of this diff doesn't work 
(or if it breaks your kernel).
