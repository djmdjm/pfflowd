Welcome to pfflowd, a PF to NetFlow converter daemon

pfflowd is a daemon which converts status update packets from pf(4) sent 
over its pfsync(4) interface to Cisco NetFlow(tm) datagrams. These UDP 
datagrams are then exported to a host of your choice.

More details about pfflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpage, which you can view prior to installation using 

/usr/bin/nroff -mandoc pfflowd.8 | less

pfflowd itself is licensed under a two-term BSD license (see the source
files for details).
