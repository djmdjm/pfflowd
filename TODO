* Testing, testing, testing

* Allow limiting of which "keep state" rules generate netflow record
  - One way: lookup rule label and allow generation of flow records for
    states whose labels match
    - What to do if ruleset changes under us?

* sflow export (www.sflow.org)

* IPv6 export support
  - Needs sflow, as Netflow doesn't do IPv6

* Cleanup of code
  - Kill globals in favour of ctxt

* Import features from softflowd
  - Basic statistics
  - Control program

* More netflow fields
  - Most require kernel support
  - May be able to (partially) infer tcp flags
